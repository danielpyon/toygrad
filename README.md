# toygrad: neural networks from scratch

Toy implementation of autograd and neural network API.

## TODO:

* Add ```zero_grad``` to Module (need for training)
* Add ```parameters``` to Module (need for updating weights)
* Don't update weights inside of ReLUNeuron, just calculate the gradients
* Find good binary classification dataset
